            <p>Meet our fantastic feline friends, and the current stars you'll see and hear plenty of! Looking for kitties past? Check out our <a href="/memorial">angels</a> page to read about them.</p>

            <h2>Caramel</h2>
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/wZ7ShxXk/caramel.jpg" alt="Caramel, laying down, a paw outstretched on a blanket">
            <p> The most gentle, shy, and sensitive of the bunch, Caramel is the twin and littermate of Cheesecake and best friend to Dandy. Very polite, he's identified by his sharper features, silkier coat, clean white face, and near-solid orange back. He's the first to run at sudden movements or newcomers, having spent kittenhood hiding from anyone without four paws, but remembers common friends and family well enough to brave a small crowd sometimes.</p>
            <p>His zoomies are spent playing with his brothers and feather toys, and he prefers to wait for Dandy before having any outdoor adventures. He may not be a lap cat, but he loves a tummy pet, and thoroughly enjoys a good brushing.</p>

            <h2>Cheesecake</h2>
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/Hf9q7FFx/cheesecake.jpg" alt="Cheesecake, laying down and looking past the camera">
            <p> Caramel's mischievous brother, Cheesecake loves to cause trouble and have fun, using the brain cell he borrows for exactly those activities. A regular chirper, he's identified by his fluffier coat, orange-spotted mouth, freckled nose, and the white triangle on his back we call the slice he stole. While he prides himself on being independent and hating cuddles, Cheese regularly lays right beside and up against humans he likes, but he's not cuddly he swears.</p>
            <p>While skittish with new folk, he loves a full-body pet and basks in attention - which makes his habit of chewing the brush rather than enjoying it a bit baffling. His favorite hobby by far is irritating the girls, followed closely by pretending to be a big tough fighter whenever he catches sight of a stray. </p>

            <h2>Cosette</h2>
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/xtf7fr9D/cosey.jpg" alt="Cosette, sitting up, both green and gray eyes visible">
            <p> As a kitten, Cosette was dropped off near an old rental and made a long, three-hour trip with a stranger (her grandpa) to her new home. Little did she know she'd then go to college to major in Mischief, and wind up the smartest cat we have! Full of the tortie attitude but sweet as sugar to her family, she's not afraid to tell anybody when she's had enough.</p>
            <p>Don't worry about her right eye, though - she was born with her second eyelid conjoined to the eyeball, and doesn't know anything different. If anything, she's been the most active and efficient hunter we've had in years, bringing many a dead mole to show off her skills. She's not a fan of the boys - or E.B. for that matter - but is exceptionally protective of her humans, serving as security detail and bedtime nanny to mama. Lap cuddles aren't bad either, especially during the winter!</p>

            <h2>Dandy</h2>
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/bgH7wDDn/dandyman.jpg" alt="Dandy, sitting and looking at an angle to the camera">
            <p>The youngest of our kitty crew, Dandy showed up just over a week after the worst year, where we lost three of our angels, and has been proven time and again to have been sent by <a href="/memorial#Stripe">Stripe</a>. Clever as a whip and a fiend for treats, Dandy loves being included in any activity from bedtime to asking for food - even when he's not actually hungry.</p>
            <p>Make no mistake, though: he's a love of any container big or small, and has jumped into many a freshly-unpacked bag without hesitation or concern for where it may be going. He spends much of his time playing with his bestie Caramel or convincing mama to give him treats for being oh-so-good and giving lap cuddles during schoolwork and playtime. Overall, though, he's a chill little guy, who's just happy to hang out and be included.</p>

            <h2>Itty Bitty, "E.B."</h2>
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/jk96twR2/eb.jpg" alt="E.B., a small loaf in a cat bed, looking at the camera">
            <p>Itty Bitty, or E.B. as we've come to call her, is our oldest lady at nearly 20 years old in 2025! A feral kitten left behind by her mother, she's still barely 5lbs, and makes up for what she lacks in size for sass. Despite never having lived without other cats, she's long since decided she's not a fan of felines, and is also a person.</p>
            <p>Where she once ruled over four much larger boys in her youth, she now throws a fit anytime another cat gets near her - which, unfortunately, is very funny to Cheesecake. The perks of having since gone deaf is that she can't hear the boys anymore, making her life much more peaceful so long as she doesn't see them. These days, she much prefers either a warm human lap, or a raised beddie out of the way of those awful cats she lives with.</p>
