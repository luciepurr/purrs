            <h2>Welcome to Lucie's Purrs!</h2>
            <p>If you've found your way here, you're probably a fellow cat lover, or at least use cute animal pictures to brighten up your day, so excellent choice. This site is a labor of love, dedicated to my cats,
                 and a desire to share them with anyone anywhere who will listen - all the better when willingly!</p>
            <p>While many posts and pictures will be current, I have several years worth - decades, really - of images, videos, and stories never told outside my circle of friends,
                that will find their place here when they come across my mind, including cats here and since gone. I only hope you enjoy the pictures and stories I can share, whether from yesterday or yesteryear,
                and just maybe, they can live on a little longer in everyone else's hearts too.</p>
